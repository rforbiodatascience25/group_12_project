## Breast Cancer Response Analysis

<br><br><br> \### **Group 12:**

Sofie Emilie Hagelund • Henrique Gomes • Paula Meerjanssen • Shuyue Zhang • Eszter Hudra <br><br> \### Chosen dataset:

MAQC-II Project: human breast cancer (BR) dataset

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Dataset Overview

-   **Demographics**: Age, Race
-   **Clinical (in Grades):**
    -   Tumor Size before Treatment
    -   Lymph node involvement before Treatment
    -   Grade/Level of Aggressiveness
-   **Receptor Status(+/-):**
    -   Estrogen Receptor
    -   Progesterone Receptor
    -   HER2 Receptor
-   **Treatments**
-   **Response to Treatment**:
    -   pCR = pathological complete response (=good)
    -   RD = residual disease (=bad)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Demographics - Age and Race

![](presentation_files/04.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Breast cancer patients are mainly white and between the ages of 40-59.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Age and Genotype

![](presentation_files/23.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **The most common Genotype trend is**
    -   ER+, PR+, HER2-
    -   ER-, PR-, HER2- (Triple negative)

There is [no clear]{.underline} correlation between age and genotype.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Do the theoretically predicted prognoses for the genotypes match the observed responses in the dataset?

*ER+ patients have the worst treatment response*

![](presentation_files/18.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **Surprisingly**:
    -   ER+ patients have the worst treatment response.
    -   HER2+ only patients and triple-negative patients have the best treatment response.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Does the treatment response from the genotypes correlate with tumor aggressiveness, size, and lymph node involvement?

*Treatment response does not correlate with tumor aggressiveness*

![](presentation_files/19.png){fig-align="center"}

-   ER+ do not have a more aggressive tumor grade = no correlation to response.
-   ER-, PR- have a more aggressive tumor grade = no correlation to response.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Does the treatment response from the genotypes correlate with tumor aggressiveness, size, and lymph node involvement?

*Treatment response does not correlate with tumor size*

![](presentation_files/20.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Most of the genotypes have a tumor size of 2, or developed into size 3-4. Especially the case for:

    -   ER+ genotype, and ER-, PR- genotype combinations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Does the treatment response from the genotypes correlate with tumor aggressiveness, size, and lymph node involvement?

*Treatment response does not correlate with lymph node involvement*

![](presentation_files/21.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Generally, following genotypes have the most lymph node involvement:

    -   ER+, PR-, HER2-

    -   ER-,PR-, HER2+

    -   ER-, PR-, HER2- (triple negative)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Does the response and treatment type give any insights into whether a specific treatment is favorable for certain genotypes?

*More treatment options lead to better response*

![](presentation_files/22.png){fig-align="center"}

-   The last two groups were exposed to the most different treatment options:

    -   ER-,PR-, HER2+ and ER-, PR-, HER2- (triple negative)

-   A general broad TFAC and TFEC is not working for ER+ patients.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion/Discussion

<br><br><br><br> - More personalized treatment options give better response. <br><br> - The level of aggressiveness, tumor size, and lymph node involvement do not necessarily mean a bad response if personalized treatment is an option.
