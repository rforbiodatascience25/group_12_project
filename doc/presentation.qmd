# 2. Introduction

-   Original topic - Oncology

-   Now chosen specifically Breast Cancer

    -   MAQC-II Project: human breast cancer (BR) dataset

# 3. Materials and Methods

### Description of the Dataset:

#### **MAQC-II Project: human breast cancer (BR) dataset**

-   **Sample name**
-   **Age**
-   **Race**
-   **pCR vs RD (response from treatment)**
    -   pCR = pathological complete response (=good)

    -   RD = residual disease (=bad)
-   **Tumor (0-4) size before treatment**
    -   The higher, the bigger the size
-   **Lymph node (0-3) involvement before treatment**
    -   The higher, the more lymph node involvement
-   **Grade/Level of aggressiveness (1-3)**
    -   The higher the more aggressive
-   **Treatments**
-   **Receptor status** (+/-)
    -   Receptor positive (+) = better prognosis
        -   Estrogen receptor status
        -   Progesterone receptor status
        -   HER2 receptor status
        -   Triple negative = ER-, PR-, HER2-

# 4. Demographics - Age and Race

\*\* INSERT GRAPH 04 \*\*

-   Breast cancer patients are mainly white and between the ages of 40-59.

# 5. Age and Genotype

\*\* INSERT GRAPH 23 \*\*

-   **The most common Genotype trend is**
    -   ER+, PR+, HER2-
    -   ER-, PR-, HER2- (Triple negative)

There is [no clear]{.underline} correlation between age and genotype.

### *Person 2*

# 6. Aim #1

*Do the theoretically predicted prognoses for the genotypes match the observed responses in the dataset?*

# 7. ER+ patients have the worst treatment response

\*\* INSERT GRAPH 18 \*\*

**Surprisingly**:

-   ER+ patients have the worst treatment response.

-   HER+ only patients and triple-negative patients have the best treatment response.

### *Person 3*

# 8. Aim #2

*Does the treatment response from the genotypes correlate with tumor aggressiveness, size, and lymph node involvement?*

# 9. Treatment response does not correlate with tumor aggressiveness

\*\* INSERT GRAPH 19 \*\*

-   Even though being ER+ does have the worst response, they do not have a more aggressive tumor grade.

-   Being ER-, PR- leads to a more aggressive tumor grade, even though they had the best response.

**\>\>\> Treatment response [does not]{.underline} correlate with tumor aggressiveness.**

# 10. Treatment response does not correlate with tumor size

\*\* INSERT GRAPH 20 \*\*

-   Most of the genotypes have a tumor size 2, or have developed into size 3-4. Especially the case for:

    -   ER+ genotype

    -   ER-, PR- genotype combinations.

**\>\>\> Treatment response [does not]{.underline} correlate with tumor size.**

# 11. Treatment response does not correlate with lymph node involvement

\*\* INSERT GRAPH 21 \*\*

Generally, it seems that following genotypes have most lymph node involvement:

-   ER+, PR-, HER2-

-   ER-,PR-, HER2+

-   ER-, PR-, HER2- (triple negative)

**\>\>\> Treatment response [does not]{.underline} correlate with lymph node involvement.**

### *Person 4*

# 12. Aim #3

*Does the response and treatment type give any insights into whether a specific treatment is favorable for certain genotypes?*

# 13. More treatment options leads to better response

\*\* INSERT GRAPH 22 \*\*

-   The last two groups were exposed to most different treatment options:

    -   ER-,PR-, HER2+

    -   ER-, PR-, HER2- (triple negative)

<!-- -->

-   A general broad TFAC and TFEC is not working for ER+ patients.

### *Person 5*

# 14. Conclusion/Discussion

-   More personalized treatment options give better response.

-   The level of aggressiveness, tumor size, and lymph node involvement do not necessarily mean a bad response if personalized treatment is an option.
