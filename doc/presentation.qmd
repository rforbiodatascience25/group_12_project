# 2. Introduction

-   Original topic - Oncology

-   Now chosen specifically Breast Cancer

    -   MAQC-II Project: human breast cancer (BR) dataset

# 3. Materials and Methods

### Description of the Dataset:

#### **MAQC-II Project: human breast cancer (BR) dataset**

-   **Sample name**
-   **Age**
-   **Race**
-   **pCR vs RD (response from treatment)**
    -   pCR = pathological complete response (=good)

    -   RD = residual disease (=bad)
-   **Tumor (0-4) size before treatment**
    -   The higher, the bigger the size
-   **Lymph node (0-3) involvement before treatment**
    -   The higher, the more lymph node involvement
-   **Grade/Level of aggressiveness (1-3)**
    -   The higher the more aggressive
-   **Treatments**
-   **Receptor status** (+/-)
    -   Receptor positive (+) = better prognosis
        -   Estrogen receptor status
        -   Progesterone receptor status
        -   HER2 receptor status
        -   Triple negative = ER-, PR-, HER2-

# 4. Demographics - Age and Race

\*\* INSERT GRAPH 04 \*\*

-   Breast cancer patients are mainly white and between the ages of 40-59.

# 5. Age and Genotype 

\*\* INSERT GRAPH 23 \*\*

-   **The most common Genotype trend is**
    -   ER+, PR+, HER2-
    -   ER-, PR-, HER2- (Triple negative)

There is [no clear]{.underline} correlation between age and genotype.

### *Person 2*

# 6. Aim #1

*Do the theoretically predicted prognoses for the genotypes match the observed responses in the dataset?*

# 7. ER+ patients have the worst treatment response

\*\* INSERT GRAPH 18 \*\*

**Surprisingly**:

-   ER+ patients have the worst treatment response.

-   HER+ only patients and triple-negative patients have the best treatment response.

### *Person 3*

# 8. Aim #2

*Does the treatment response correlate with tumor aggressiveness, size, and the lymph node involvement?*

# 9. Analysis 2 (This will need to be more slides, as there are more parts of the question)

\*\* INSERT GRAPH 19 \*\*

Answering question 2

-   Discriptive headline

-   Plot

### *Person 4*

# 10. Aim #3

# 11. Analysis 3

### *Person 5*

# 12. Conclusion/Discussion

-   Summarise all we found

-   e.g. "The factors that have biggest effect: ..."

-   Personalised threapy is best
