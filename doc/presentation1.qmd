## Introduction

### Group 12  
Sofie Emilie Hagelund • Henrique Gomes • Paula Meerjanssen • Shuyue Zhang • Eszter Hudra



### Objective  
Explore how **genotype**, **tumor characteristics**, and **treatments** relate to **treatment response** in breast cancer.

---

## Dataset Overview

- MAQC-II breast cancer dataset  

- Variables analyzed:
  - Demographics: Age, Race  
  - Clinical: Tumor size, Lymph nodes, Grade  
  - Biology: ER, PR, HER2  
  - Outcome: pCR (good) vs RD (bad)

---

## Demographics

![](presentation_files/04.png){fig-align="center"}

- Majority: white, age 40–59

---

## Genotype Distribution

![](presentation_files/23.png){fig-align="center"}

- Frequent patterns: ER+, PR+, HER2– & triple negative  
- No visible age–genotype relationship

---

## Aim 1: Genotype vs Treatment Response

**Do expected prognoses match observed outcomes?**

---

## Observed Response Patterns

![](presentation_files/18.png){fig-align="center"}

- ER+ = *worst* response  
- Triple negative & HER2+ only = *best* response  
- Opposes typical clinical expectations

---

## Aim 2: Tumor Characteristics

**Do size, grade, or lymph nodes predict response?**

---

## No Predictive Value

![](presentation_files/19.png){fig-align="center"}

- ER+ poor response not explained by aggressiveness  
- ER-/PR- aggressive tumors still respond well  
- Size & lymph nodes show **no consistent correlation**

---

## Aim 3: Treatment Types

**Do specific genotypes benefit from specific treatments?**

---

## Treatment Diversity Improves Outcomes

![](presentation_files/22.png){fig-align="center"}

- Genotypes receiving **more specialized treatments** → better outcomes  
- TFAC/TFEC performs poorly for ER+ patients

---

## Final Conclusion

- **Genotype** predicts response better than size/grade  
- **Personalized treatment** significantly improves outcomes  
- Classical prognoses (e.g., ER+) don't always match real data  
- Supports **genotype-guided therapy strategies**
