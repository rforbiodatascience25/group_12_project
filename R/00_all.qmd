## Full list of all analysis we created

Barplots of Henrique:

-   05 E and P receptor statuses vs cancer aggressiveness

-   06 HER2 receptor status vs cancer aggressiveness

-   07 HER2 receptor status vs tumor size before treatment

-   08 HER2 receptor status vs nodes before treatment

-   09 E and P receptor statuses vs treatment outcome

-   10 HER2 receptor status vs treatment outcome

-   11 Cancer aggressiveness vs treatment outcome

Main plots of Paula and Sylvia:

-   12 - Age vs. Outcome

-   13 - Age and Race vs. Aggressivness and Tumor Size

-   14 - Tumorsize, Lymphnodes and Aggression Comparison

-   15 - Response to Treatment according to Receptor Status

-   16 - Her2 fish vs. Her2 receptor positive or negative and linear regression of her2 and tumor size

-   17 - PCA with colouring according to receptor positiveness or negativeness

Final plots of Sofie:

-   18 (Response (pCR vs RD) by ER/PR/HER2 Genotypes)

-   19 (Tumor Grade (1–3) by ER/PR/HER2 Genotypes)

-   20 (Tumor Size Before Treatment by ER/PR/HER2 Genotypes)

-   21 (Lymph Node Status Before Treatment by ER/PR/HER2 Genotypes)

-   22 (Treatment Distribution Across ER/PR/HER2 Genotypes)

## What to include:
